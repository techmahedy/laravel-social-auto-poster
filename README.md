## Step Two
In this second step, You need to publish autoposter vendor to get `config/autoposter.php`.

`php artisan vendor:publish --provider='Laravelia\Autoposter\AutoPosterServiceProvider'`

###

This command will generate `config/autoposter.php` file and configure it with your credentials like this ðŸ¦Š

`your_project/config/autoposter.php`
###
```
<?php

return [
    'facebook' => [
        'APP_ID' => '',
        'APP_SECRET' => '',
        'PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN' =>'',
        'FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID' => '',
        'ENABLE_FACEBOOK_PAGE_SHARE' => false,
    ],
    'tumblr' => [
        'CONSUMER_KEY' => '',
        'SECRET_KEY' => '',
        'TOKEN' => '',
        'TOKEN_SECRET' => '',
        'BLOG_NAME' => '',
        'ENABLE_TUMBLR_SHARE' => false
    ]
